## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued Development
Since this project involved similar design components with different data, I would like to utilize javascript to send multiple attributes to a custom element as opposed to recreating the same component over and over again.
